	<h3 class = subheaders>1. I'm concerned about a low rating I received on a test.  Can you review it?</h3>
	<p class = article>Our Quality Review Team reviews all one and two star ratings. Once they've reviewed your test, you'll be notified of their decision. You can see the reviewers comments in your completed tests tab by mousing over the blue speech bubble.</p>
	<img class = articleimage src = "images/ratings.png" alt="Where to find ratings on your Dashboard.">
	<p class = article>Please allow between 3-5 days for the review process to complete. Because of time and manpower limitations, we're unable to review ratings above two stars.</p>
	</br>
	<h3 class = subheaders>2. Why have I have not been rated?</h3>
	<p class = article>While we encourage our customers to rate and comment, they’re not required to. It’s very common that most of your tests will go without rating. Unrated tests don’t impact your tester score or diminish your chances of getting new tests.

	To learn how to be a 5-star tester, take the lessons on the Success Center tab of your dashboard or check out the following resources:</br>
	<a href = "#">Best Practices</a></br>
	<a href = "#">Tips from Testers</a></p>
	<h3 class = subheaders>3. I have a “Test in Progress” message on my dashboard even though I’m not taking a test. How do I remove it from my dashboard?</h3>
	<p class = article>If you just completed a test or exited a test for any reason, your dashboard may say that the test is still in progress. Our system will automatically release you once you reach the test’s time limit. In most cases, your dashboard will update within an hour.</br>
	If you are still experiencing issues, please reach out to us at <a href = "mailto:support@usertesting.com.">support@usertesting.com.</a></p>
	</br>
	<h3 class = subheaders>4. How do you tell the difference between webcam, app, and desktop test?</h3>
	<p class = article>You may see a combination of desktop, mobile app, and webcam tests on your dashboard.  They look similar, but here are a few key things to help you tell the difference!</br>
	Computer:</br>
	<img class = articleimage src = "images/computer.png" alt="computer test"><br>
	Computer tests are pretty straight forward.  On the left you will see whether you need to use a PC or a Mac.  You'll be presented the scenario and then you have the option to view or decline the test.</br>
	Mobile App:</br>
	<img class = articleimage src = "images/mobileapp.png" alt="mobile test"><br>
	Many of the iOS and Android tests are taken with our UserTesting app.  To view and accept the test, you'll need to download the app and sign in with your UserTesting account information. You can also see what device you'll need on the left.</br>
	Webcam:<br>
	<img class = articleimage src = "images/webcam.png" alt="webcam test"><br>
	Webcam testing is slightly different than the other two ways. For this type of testing, you'll need to accept the test on your computer and then go on your mobile device to either download the customer's app or visit their website.  You will not need our UserTesting mobile app to take webcam tests.

	<h3 class = subheaders>5. How do I delete my account?</h3>
	<p class = article>You don't need to delete your account, if you plan to come back. We'll keep it safe while you're gone! If you do decide to delete your account and want to test again, you may need to re-apply to be a tester.<br>
	If you still want us to delete your account, please reach out to us at <a href = "mailto: support@usertesting.com">support@usertesting.com</a>.</p>
	<h3 class = subheaders>6. I exited the test, how can I get back? Can I try again?</h3>
	<p class = article>In order to ensure our customers get their results as fast as possible, you’ll be released from a test if:</p>
	<ul class = articlelists>
	<li>you accidentally exited the test</li>
	<li>you closed the screen recorder</li>
	<li>the screen recorder crashed or quited unexpectedly (In this case, please send us your <a href = "#">log files</a>)</li>
	<li>your computer crashed</li>
	</ul>
	<p class = article>Once you’ve been released from a test, it’ll be automatically sent to other users and you won’t be able to take the test again. You may see a “<a href = "#">Test in Progress</a>” message on your dashboard, please set assured this message will go away within an hour, and you’ll be able to take other tests then.<br>
	We’re unable to have you retake a test again if you just completed it and feel you didn’t do well. Please write in to <a href = "mailto:support@usertesting.com">support@usertesting.com</a>, and we can remove you from the test if the customer hasn’t reviewed your video yet.</p>
	<h3 class = subheaders>7. I've taken this test before, can I take it again?</h3>
	<p class = article>Since most of our customers prefer “fresh eyes”, we ask you refrain from taking the same test again. If you’re already taking a test and you found it very similar to a test you’ve taken before, please <a href = "#">report a problem</a> and exit the test. This will prevent you from getting a low rating and void payment.</p>
	<h3 class = subheaders>8. The screener doesn't apply to me, what do I do?</h3>
	<p class = article>A lot of customers use screener questions to filter for more specific requirements. If you’re taking a screener and none of the options applies to you, please use the Back button on your browser to go back to the previous page, where you can see other available tests.</p>
